# The-Last-Quest-Story-Driven-2D-Action-Platformer-Godot-
A story-driven 2D action platformer made in Godot for a game jam, featuring combat, platforming, and narrative-focused gameplay.

**The Last Quest**

The Last Quest is a story-driven 2D action platformer developed in Godot Engine for a game jam.

You play as a former hero who has abandoned his life of battle, living quietly away from the world. When a king arrives with news of a cursed castle filled with monsters—and offers a chance to recover what was once lost—you are forced to confront your past.

**The game focuses on:**

Responsive 2D movement and platforming
Combat-driven encounters
Environmental storytelling
A narrative centered on redemption, loss, and resolve

This project was built within a limited time frame and serves as both a complete game jam entry and a foundation for future expansion.
