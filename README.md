# The Last Quest

**The Last Quest** is a story-driven 2D action platformer developed in **Godot Engine** as part of a game jam.

You play as a retired hero who abandoned his life of battle long ago. When a lone king arrives, speaking of a cursed castle filled with monsters—and offering something impossible to ignore—you are forced to confront your past and step back into darkness.

This journey is not just about combat, but about loss, redemption, and the light that still survives in broken souls.
